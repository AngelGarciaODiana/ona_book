<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Graphs everywhere!</h1>
<p>If you have ever been lucky enough to pay a visit to the vibrant Russian city of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast, it’s likely to have been a trip you remember. An unusual exclave of the massive Russian Federation, you cannot get to the remainder of Russia from Kaliningrad over land without crossing through at least two other countries. Things have landed this way, like they always do, because of the cards dealt by history. The strategic importance endowed to Kaliningrad owing to its prime coastal position placed it in the center of a tug-of-war, changing hands on numerous occasions over the centuries. At the end of the Second World War as Stalin cast his eye over the ruins of Europe, he considered the city far too strategically important to be left in the hands of any other Eastern-bloc state, and so despite the physical separation it was duly deemed to be Russia’s sovereign territory.</p>
<p>As you might expect, Kaliningrad has only been so named since it became part of the USSR in 1946. Prior to this, and stretching back to the middle ages, it was known as Königsberg — the King’s Mountain — named in honor of King Ottokar II. Steeped in glorious and tragic history, the city is rich in museums, castles, cathedrals and monuments from its past. But for mathematicians like me, Königsberg is perhaps best known for a simple, unassuming puzzle that occupied the minds of many a renaissance intellectual in the 17th and 18th centuries — a problem which, it could be argued, laid the foundations for the highly connected world we live in today.</p>
<p>Königsberg was (and still is, presumably) separated in two by the River Pregel. As the Pregel breaks towards the Baltic sea, two islands form a part of the city. This leads to a city comprised of four land masses. The two mainland masses on either side of the river (known as Altstadt-Loebenicht and Vorstadt-Haberberg) and the two island land masses (Lomse and Kneiphof). A total of seven bridges connected these land masses<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Figure <a href="graphs-everywhere.html#fig:koenigsberg">1.1</a> is a suitably historic map of the situation. The island on the left is Kneiphof and the island on the right is Lomse. The beautiful dress worn by the lady in the foreground of this picture is large enough so that one of the seven bridges is entirely covered by it, but you can see the other six.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The puzzle went like this: is it possible to devise a walk where you would set foot on all four land masses while crossing all seven bridges only once? There was a strong hunch from trial and error that the answer was no — the problem was how to prove this mathematically. No effective techniques had yet been discovered to allow such a proof.</p>
<p>Leonhard Euler was an 18th century Swiss mathematician who spent the majority of his life in St Petersburg or Berlin. A prolific original thinker, Euler is considered by many as the greatest mathematician of all time. It is impossible to study mathematics even at high school without being constantly exposed to Euler’s work. He popularized the greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to denote Archimedes’ constant ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle, he formalized the letter <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to denote the imaginary number <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> and he defined the exponential constant <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> which is known as <em>Euler’s number</em>. Living between Prussia and Russia at the time of the problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, he set about finding a solution, and the one he discovered is both a testament to the beauty of mathematical proof and the first use of the concept of a graph to solve a mathematical problem.</p>
<p>The first thing Euler did - as any good mathematician will always do - is strip the problem of all its extraneous information and reduce it to its most minimal form. The problem merely requires one to set foot on a land mass. It is not concerned with what route one takes while on that land mass. Therefore we can represent each of the four land masses as dots. We can then draw lines between the dots to represent the bridges. This, he reasoned, leads to a diagram like that in Interactive Figure <a href="graphs-everywhere.html#fig:euler-graph">1.2</a>. The picture can be drawn in infinitely many ways, but it will always be four dots connected by seven lines in the same configuration. If you like, move the nodes around to see what I mean.</p>

Figure 1.2: A minimal representation of the <em>Seven Bridges of Königsberg</em> problem
</p>
</div>
<p>First, Euler observed that if one starts their journey at a certain place and crosses all seven bridges once, there must have been eight total visits to places. This is because we start at a place, and every time we cross a bridge, we add another place to our walk. So if we cross seven bridges, we must visit eight places (including repeat visits to a place).</p>
<p>Euler then looked at any siuation where you have a place A connected to other places by an <em>odd number</em> of bridges. If there was one bridge and it was crossed once, we would only be in place A once - either at the beginning or end of the journey. If there were three bridges and all were crossed once, place A would have been visited twice no matter where we started. If there were five bridges, place A would have been visited three times. If there were <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bridges, place A would have been visited <span class="math inline">\((n+1)/2\)</span> times.</p>
<p>Now Euler calculated how many place visits this would mean for Königsberg. Since Kneiphof has five bridges to other places, if all were crossed once Kneiphof would have been visited 3 times. The other three places each have three bridges connecting them, so any such walk would result in 2 visits to each place. Adding all this up, this means that if a walk existed through all four places where every bridge was used only once, there must be nine total place visits. Since this contradicts Euler’s earlier observation that such a walk must involve only eight place visits, we must conclude that such a walk does not exist.</p>
<p>Euler’s proof was the first time a graph like the one in Interactive Figure <a href="graphs-everywhere.html#fig:euler-graph">1.2</a> was used to solve a problem. The solution also involved concepts that would later become critical in the study of graphs. Euler set up the places as <em>vertices</em> or <em>nodes</em> of the graph and he set up the bridges as <em>edges</em>. The proof depends on a conclusion about the number of edges connected to a vertex, which later became known as the <em>degree</em> of a vertex. The proof required the study of <em>walks</em> or <em>paths</em> through the graph. The requirement that a walk could only use each edge once became known as an <em>Euler walk</em> and various algorithms exist today to calculate Euler walks for problems such as constructing DNA sequences from their fragments<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Little was Euler to know the Pandora’s Box he had opened.</p>

You could use your software to calculate the degrees of the vertices of the graph. For example in R, if you have the data loaded into an <code>igraph</code> object, you can use <code>igraph::degree()</code> to get a vector showing you the degrees of each vertex.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Graphs and networks are all around us</h2>
<p>Graphs and networks have existed since long before Euler, and probably since the beginning of time itself. They exist physically, such as in a spider’s web, in the electrical wiring of your home or in the molecules that make up the universe. Since the time of Euler, graphs have also existed conceptually as the best way we can describe many complex systems, and in this book we will focus on the use of graphs to describe complex systems related to people, groups, organizations or other societal constructs. Before we jump into our core topic, it is worth taking a few moments to appreciate how fundamental graphs are to both science and to everyday life by discussing a few examples of the practical use of graphs to solve problems.</p>
<p>Whenever objects move physically through a network structure, it makes sense that graph theory will be of great use in solving problems of routing and optimization. An obvious example of this is whenever a route is planned on Google or Apple Maps, or on a SatNav system. When you search a driving route to a given destination, the underlying calculation involves streets and roads as edges and intersections as vertices. The fastest routes are calculated based on stored properties of the edges such as the road length, road speed limit and live traffic information. The underlying graphs are updated over time with edges switched on and off according to information on road closures<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. It doesn’t just have to be road networks of course. Rail, air and other forms of transport networks make great use of graph theory. Maybe you are sitting on a train while reading this book, and if you are have a look around you for the route map you’ll see a graph right there. Essential public services such as the management of sewerage networks is an example of one of the less glamorous fields where graph theory is essential to operational calculations and decisions. If there is a sudden cold snap in a city and roads need to be de-iced, the problem of how to get around the city in an efficient way, saving resources by minimizing the route while still covering all the critical areas is one Euler would have loved.</p>
<p>The objects that move through networks are often electronic in nature, such as bytes of code or electrical currents. National and local power grids are managed with the help of graph theory. Communications networks, telephone, satellite, cable, internet are all networks where nodes are connection points such as junctions or receiver points and edges can be visible in the form of underground or undersea cables or invisible in the form of signals sent through the air or into space.</p>
<p>In the sciences, graphs are essential as models of biological, chemical or physical processes or phenomena. Chemical Graph Theory (CGT) deals with the applications of graph theory to molecular problems. In condensed matter physics, graph theory is essential in quantitatively modeling atomic structures. In biology and biochemistry, graphs are important in understanding the study of the spread of disease in epidemic models, in the study of genomics and DNA, in the neuroscientific modeling of brain functioning and in the ecological modeling of species migration. In the computational sciences, huge progress has been made in the storing of data thanks to databases that have a graph structure, and many of the latest algorithms used in Machine Learning operate through graph like structures like trees or neural networks. In linguistics, graphs have facilitated great advances in the study of natural language as the study of discrete words and phrases that are related to each other. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Arguably, the area where graphs have impacted our day to day lives the most in recent decades, however, is in the development of online communities which depend on them. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and countless others use graphs to connect people in ways that have changed many of our lives immeasurably. Friendships and acquaintances happen today between people who have never and often will never meet physically. Countless relationships, marriages and families have been brought into existence. Long lost families separated by adoption or abandonment have found each other again. Job opportunities have been created and filled. Individuals with common interests have been connected irrelevant of where they are located. The positives and negatives of this rapid and paradigm-shifting rise in social networking are vigorously debated, but what cannot be denied is that without graph theory they would not exist.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Graph theory in the analysis of people and groups</h2>
<p>In the social sciences and in the study of people and groups, the increasing prevalence of network data and the ability to analyze it using graph-theoretic methods have opened up rich and continuously developing veins of research that encompass both academic and enterprise settings. Much of the work that is done can be grouped into a few different study areas.</p>
<div id="the-study-of-connection" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> The study of connection</h3>
<p>In most organizations, institutions and societal groups, connection is considered a critical facilitator of happiness, motivation, productivity and progress. The psychological concept of <em>belongingness</em>, which describes a human need to connect, affiliate and be accepted by others, is an important element of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Empirically, greater social connection has been associated with positive effects on mental and physical health, cognitive functioning, life expectancy and even wound healing (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-holt-lunstad1" role="doc-biblioref">Julianne Holt-Lunstad</a> (<a href="#ref-holt-lunstad1" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>). Conversely, lack of connection — or loneliness — is of research interest because of its potential negative effects on mental wellbeing, productivity and workplace performance. A meta-analytic review of the relationship between social relationships and mortality risk concluded that lack of social connection carries a higher risk of premature mortality than obesity (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-holt-lunstad2" role="doc-biblioref">J. Holt-Lunstad et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-holt-lunstad2" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In workplace settings, economic, sociology and psychology practitioners and academics are showing an increasing amount of interest in connection and how it affects performance, productivity and employee retention. Empirical research has demonstrated links between friendship at work and improved work engagement and productivity (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-rath" role="doc-biblioref">Rath</a> (<a href="#ref-rath" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>), and social interaction at work (whether work-related or otherwise) has been associated with improved outcomes (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-olguin" role="doc-biblioref">Olguin et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-olguin" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>The ability to analyse connection in the workplace and in society-at-large will become increasingly important as we move further into the 21st century. The variety of data that could represent connection is expanding. Connection between people can now be defined by in person interaction, electronic transaction and even assumed connection through overlaps in geographic location or in work or personal activities. Strong analytic techniques will be necessary to support evidence-based practice, because not all measures of connection are meaningful to the outcomes being researched and, even when they have been shown to be meaningful, resulting interventions do not always have the expected effects (for example, a study by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-feld" role="doc-biblioref">Feld and Carter</a> (<a href="#ref-feld" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> demonstrated that deliberate attempts to increase interracial contact in American schools actually ended up causing greater racial segregation).</p>
